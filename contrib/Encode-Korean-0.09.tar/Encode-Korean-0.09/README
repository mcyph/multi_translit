NAME
    Encode::Korean - Perl extension for Encodings of Korean Language

SYNOPSIS
      use Encode::Korean;

      while($line = <>) {
        print encode 'utf8', decode $enc, $line;
      }

AKNOWLEDGEMENT
    Thanks to Otakar Smrz, who wrote Encode::Arabic module, which inspired
    me with the 'philosophy' of Encode::Encoding module and the idea of mode
    system.

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a wrapper for Korean encoding modules.

  ENCODINGS BASED ON TRANSLITERATION
   NOTE or WARNING
    The provided transliteration is NOT a public romanization nor phonemic
    transcription, BUT a scientific romanization or letter-to-letter
    transliteration. It DOES NOT take into account morphophonemic changes
    nor natural pronunciations, BUT DOES reflect closely the original hangul
    orthography and make the reverse transliteration possible.

    If you're looking for a general romanizer (that does 'transcription'),
    this module is not the one you want.

   IMPLEMENTATION
    These encodings are implemented by using
    Encode::Korean::TransliteratorGenerator class which generates
    transliteration-based encoding objects. It makes you easily write a new
    transliteration-based encoding module or just convert Korean script into
    something, for example, into Cyrillic, IPA, or Greek.

   LIST OF ENCODINGS
    ISO_TS_11941
        Encode::Korean::ISO_TS_11941 implements an encoding system based on
        the transliteration method of ISO TS 11941: 1996, Technical
        Specification, First Edition 1996-12-01, Information Documentation
        -- Transliteration of Korean script into Latin Characters.

    SKR_2000
        Encode::Korean::SKR_2000 implements an encoding system based on
        South Korean romanization system, officially released on July 7,
        2000 by South Korean Ministry of Culture and Tourism (aka. Revised
        Romanization of Korean)

    SKR_1984
        Encode::Korean::SKR_1984 implements an encoding system based on
        South Korean romanization system, officially released on January 1,
        1984 by South Korean Ministry of Education.

        It is not ideal for encodings, since it uses non-ASCII characters:
        latin small letter o with breve (\x{014F}) and latin small letter u
        with breve (\x{016D}).

    SKR_1959
        Encode::Korean::SKR_1959 implements an encoding system based on
        South Korean romanization system, officially released in 1959 by
        South Korean Ministry of Education.

    NKR_1992
        Encode::Korean::NKR_1992 implements an encoding system based on
        North Korean Romanizaiton (National system of DPKR), released in
        1992 by Chosun Gwahagwon.

        It is not ideal for encodings, since it uses non-ASCII characters.

    HSR Encode::Korean::HSR implements an encoding system based on the
        transliteration method of Hangeul Society Romanization, released in
        1984.

    MRR Encode::Korean::MRR implements an encoding system based on
        McCune-Reischauer Romanization, created in 1937 by George M. McCune
        and Edwin O. Reischauer. It is the most widely used method outside
        of Koreas.

        It is not ideal for encodings, since it uses non-ASCII characters.

    Yale
        Encode::Korean::Yale implements an encoding system of Korean based
        on the transliteration method of Yale Romanization for Korean
        Language, developed by S. Martin and his colleagues at Yale
        University.

    SKATS
        Encode::Korean::SKATS implements an encoding system of Korean based
        on SKATS (Standar Korean Alphabet Transliteration System). It is not
        a true romaniztion (transliteration). SKATS maps Hangul Jamos to
        Latin alphabet equivalents as Morse code. It doesn't care about
        linguistic knowledge but can be perfectly recoverd to original
        Korean letters.

  EXPORTS & MODES
    Mode system is introduced but not implemented yet for real usage. The
    idea of modes is taken from Encode::Arabic. Refer to it for instruction.
